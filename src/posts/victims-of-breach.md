Firstly, the website administration has a responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect user data and to ensure that it is properly encrypted and secured. If the website administration failed to take these measures and the data was breached as a result, they could be considered responsible for the breach and any damages that resulted from it.

Secondly, the hackers who breached the data could be considered responsible for any damages that resulted from their actions. If the hackers were able to access the unencrypted data due to a failure on the part of the website administration to properly secure it, the hackers could still be held responsible for any damages they caused by accessing and potentially misusing the data.

In terms of liability for damages, the specific laws and regulations that apply in the jurisdiction where the breach occurred would dictate who is liable. For example, in some cases, the website administration could be held liable for damages if they failed to properly secure user data. In other cases, the hackers could be held liable for any damages they caused.

Ultimately, the responsibility and liability for a data breach will depend on the specific circumstances and the laws and regulations that apply. However, it is important for companies to take the necessary steps to protect user data and to be transparent and responsible in their handling of user data.
